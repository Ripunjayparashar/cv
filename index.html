      <p><em><strong>Visonary Student</strong> With a lot of ideas </em></p>
      <p>Iam a Btech student trying to find a job right now and for that specific purpose
        iam learning to code more specifically web developement and the reason behing learning web-dev specifically is
        where ever I've seen on the internet i only see web-dev or fullstack dev jobs which might either meean that either
        there are high no. of open jobs in this position or people keep leaving this job and keep changing the field of their work
        as it's a very bad field for later in life, but whatever it is I started it a long ago and ive been at it on and off
        so now I have a bit of knowledge of this field not soo less that i can leave this and not soo high either that i can get a job.
        But now I've started it this time and I hope that i will get through it this time, I hope because thats all i can do
